Task 3

Analytics and commercial application

Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.

Here is your task
With our project coming to an end its time for us to send a report to Julia, based on our analytics from the previous tasks. We want to provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.



As best practice at Quantium, we like to use the “Pyramid Principles” framework when putting together a report for our clients. If you are not already familiar with this framework you can find quick introductions on by searching form them on the internet.



For this report, we need to include data visualisations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or next steps.



We recommend you use a tool like PowerPoint (or similar) to create your report, we have also provided you a template to help get you started.



One way to create your visualisations (graphs, charts etc) is to save your output files from task 1 & 2 and create generate your charts in Excel. You may find it helpful to create chart templates however that is not essential. We are looking for consistency here – if a series is blue in one chart it needs to remain blue throughout the presentation. Once you have created the charts in your Excel file, paste them into your PowerPoint in the order that suits best.



When you have finished creating your report, remember to save it as a PDF and send it via email to the client so they can review it prior to our meeting next week.
